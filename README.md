# Skin Textures
This mod lets you use a custom skin texture for any player, even yourself.
And the best thing? It works completely client sided.
## What this mod does
It allows resource packs to change the skin of any player based on their name or UUID.<br>
The textures must be placed in <code>assets/skintextures/textures/entity/player</code> from the root of the pack.<br>
The name of the texture file should either be the lowercase name or the lowercase UUID of the player, ending in <code>.png</code><br>
Alternatively, you can use the hash of the original skin, which you can get by shifting and right-clicking any player (useful for NPCs and such).
<br><br>
Currently the mod affects the in-game skin of players, player heads, the first-person view and the [Show Me Your Skin!](https://github.com/enjarai/show-me-your-skin) mod.<br>
If you encounter any mod incompatibilities, please let me know!
## Example file names
By name: <code>benonardo.png</code><br>
By UUID: <code>373ed407-89be-4f46-b85f-65615620d6b9.png</code><br>
By hash: <code>61a1a64d3e42a5fc54c3303a5c5d06c0617b524c6a6b44cc9f0308a7cede3050.png</code>
## Dependencies
None! Like most of my mods, it works out of the box.
