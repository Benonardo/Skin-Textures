# Skin Textures
This mod lets you use a custom skin texture for any player, even yourself.
And the best thing? It works completely client sided.
## What this mod does
It allows resource packs to change the skin of any player based on their name or UUID.<br>
The textures must be placed in <code>assets/skintextures/textures/entity/player</code> from the root of the pack.<br>
The name of the texture file should either be the lowercase name or the lowercase UUID of the player, ending in <code>.png</code>
<br><br>
Currently the mod affects the in-game skin of players, player heads, the first-person view and the [Show Me Your Skin!](https://github.com/enjarai/show-me-your-skin) mod.<br>
If you encounter any mod incompatibilities, please let me know!
## Dependencies
None! Like most of my mods, it works out of the box.
